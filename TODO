TODO List for Pod::Compiler
===========================

* how to handle POD directives within a =begin ... =end block?

* how to treat tabs ( \t ) ?

* Handle consecutive =items and assign only one node for the first one,
  but allow hyperlinks to all textual forms (very useful for perlfunc).

* honour -linelength also for command paragraphs

* test it with a complex converter

* rewrite podchecker based on this module
